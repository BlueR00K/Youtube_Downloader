# Legacy

Place your old (current) script(s) here. This directory is a placeholder so the new `webapp/` remains separate from older scripts.

Suggested steps to migrate legacy files into this folder:

1. Move existing downloader scripts and resources into this directory.
2. Update imports or references if you intend to reuse code from legacy in the new backend.

The webapp is intentionally separate and uses a modern modular layout (backend + frontend).
